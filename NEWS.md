# obisindicators 0.0.2

* Renamed functions for consistency:
  - `calc_es50()` -> `calc_indicators()`
  - `gmap_metric()` -> `gmap_indicator()`
* Fixed `gmap_indicator()` to use default Robinson projection.
* Updated vignettes with name changes and use of "indicators" over "metrics".
* Supplemented documentation for `calc_indicators()` with expected input and output columns to data frame.
* Added documentation for `occ_fk` and `occ_1960s` to `occ_2010s`
* Made generation of occ_* datasets more reproducible with `set.seed()` and sampled versions of dataset to minimize file size on Github in `data-raw/occ.R`.

# obisindicators 0.0.1

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
